 * I'll walk through the macro with the following args (used for brainfuck ">"):
 *      eamasm_offset(OFFDIR_POSITIVE, OFFMODE_REGISTER, REG_BF_POINTER)

 * * (0b1111_1110 | 0b0000_0001) evaluates to 0b1111_1111 (i.e. 0xff)
 *
 * * (3<<6) means 3, bit shifted left 6 times. 3 in binary is 0b11, and shifting
 * * that left 6 times results in 0b1100_0000, or 0xc0. 
 * * (0|03|(3<<6)), is (0|03|0xc0), or (0b0000_0000|0b0000_0011|0b1100_0000).
 * * (0b0000_0000|0b0000_0011|0b1100_0000) evaluates to 0b1100_0011 (i.e. 0xc3)
