# Eli Array Minkoff's BFC (original version)

**Also check out the
[Blazingly ðŸ”¥ fast ðŸš€ version](https://github.com/eliminmax/eambfc-rs), written
in Rust ðŸ¦€!**

An optimizing compiler for brainfuck, written in C for Unix-like systems.

Output 64-bit ELF executables that uses Linux system calls for I/O.
Currrently, it has x64_64 and arm64 backends.

I started this as an inexperienced C programmer, and this was originally an
attempt to gain practice by writing something somewhat simple yet not trivial.
As it went on, I added more and more features, created a Rust rewrite, and have
maintained feature parity between them.

## Usage

```
Usage: eambfc [options] <program.bf> [<program2.bf> ...]

 -h        - display this help text and exit
 -V        - print version information and exit
 -j        - print errors in JSON format*
             (assumes file names are UTF-8-encoded.)
 -q        - don't print errors unless -j was passed*
 -O        - enable optimization**.
 -k        - keep files that failed to compile (for debugging)
 -c        - continue to the next file instead of quitting if a
             file fails to compile
 -t count  - (only provide once) allocate <count> 4-KiB blocks for
             the tape. (defaults to 8 if not specified)
 -e ext    - (only provide once) use 'ext' as the extension for
             source files instead of '.bf'
             (This program will remove this at the end of the input
             file to create the output file name)
 -a arch   - compile for the specified architecture
             (defaults to x86_64 if not specified)**
 -A        - list supported architectures and exit

* -q and -j will not affect arguments passed before they were.

** Optimization can make error reporting less precise.

Remaining options are treated as source file names. If they don't
end with '.bf' (or the extension specified with '-e'), the program
will raise an error.
```

## Supported platforms

It should be possible to compile and run `eambfc` itself on any POSIX\* system
with a C99 compiler. If that is not the case, it's a bug.

When building `eambfc`, the backend targeting x86_64 systems is always
included. A backend for arm64 systems is also included, but the test suite
defaults to only testing the x86_64 backend.

\* *Specifically POSIX.1-2008. Compilation requires the optional C-Language
Development Utilities, or at least something similar enough. It probably works
on systems that comply with any version of the POSIX standard from POSIX.1-2001
on, and with any newer version of ISO standard C, but if it does not, it's not
considered a bug.*

## Building and Installing

```sh
# Build eambfc
make
# Run the test suite
make test
# install eambfc to /usr/local with sudo
sudo make install
# clean previous build and build with an alternative compiler
make clean; make CC=tcc
# install to an alternative path
make PREFIX="$HOME/.local" install
```

## Development Process and Standards

I have a dev branch and a main branch. When I feel like it, and all of the tests
pass, I merge the dev branch into the main branch. I work from multiple devices,
but only push changes from one. The main branch has been successfully built and
passed the full test suite on Debian 12 amd64, Debian 12 arm64 with qemu-binfmt,
and FreeBSD 14.1 amd64 with Linux binary support. Features that are documented
and exposed via command-line flags are tested, working, and complete, though
code that's part of WIP features may be present, but not activated.

The dev branch has no guarantees of any kind. It may have untested code, fatal
bugs, invalid code that won't compile at all, failing tests, undefined behavior,
improperly-formatted files, or other problems. Do not use it.

### Standards compliance

All C code and Makefiles, and most shell scripts, target the POSIX.1-2008
standard and/or the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard (i.e. C99).

Some Makefile targets are not portable - they use `gcc`-specific flags and
features, and are hard-coded to call `gcc` rather than the user-specified C
compiler.

The `release.sh` script has a large number of extra dependencies which it
documents, used for extra testing and linting, and for building source tarballs.

All files in the main branch comply with version 3.2 of the REUSE specification
for licensing information.

### Test suite

The test suite consists of a series of brainfuck programs, and a script to
compare their actual behavior against their expected behavior. Because of this,
it must be able to run the created binaries, which means that it does not work
on systems that can't run x86-64 ELF files with Linux system calls. That said, I
have successfully run the test suite in a FreeBSD VM with
[Linuxulator](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/linuxemu/) enabled, and
a Debian 12 "Bookworm" arm64 system with the `qemu-user-binfmt` package
installed.
