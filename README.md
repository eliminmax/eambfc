# Eli Array Minkoff's BFC

A non-optimizing compiler for brainfuck, written in C.

Outputs an x86_64 ELF executable that uses Linux system calls. Portability was outside of the scope of this project.

I am not an experienced C programmer, and this is an attempt to gain practice by writing something somewhat simple yet not trivial.
